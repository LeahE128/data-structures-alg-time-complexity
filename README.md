# data-structures-alg-time-complexity

This repository implements time complexity and curve fitting algorithms. 

The following tasks were implemented:

1. Write an algorithm to compute the factorial of a positive integer n
2. For different values of n, implement the algorithm using two approaches:  iterative and recursive (tail and non-tail recursions).  For each case, plot running time as a function of n and compare the achieved results 
3. Use one of the sequences obtained from task 2 as an input for search algorithms.  Implement with two methods from:  linear search, iterative binary and recursive binary
4. For each approach, compute the best and worst running times.  Give some examples by plotting the running time as afunction of n 
5. Use curve-fitting algorithms to find the equation of the running times obtained from Tasks 2-4.
